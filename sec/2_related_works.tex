\subsection{Dynamic Gaussian Splatting}
\label{sec:related_works_gaussian_splatting}
Importantly for this investigation we must go beyond the original scope of Gaussian splatting to accommodate the time-dynamic nature of the data and to apply it to tracking.  

In terms of dynamic splatting in general we will focus on the most recent in dynamic gaussian splatting

In terms of tracking we will focus on the most recent in tracking with gaussian splatting
