\section{Related Works}
To discuss the related works we will discuss the history of Cell Segmentation and Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) seperately, as so far there is not much work done which combines the two.

\subsection{Cell Segmentation}
\begin{itemize}

    \item more expession of the challenges of cell segmentation 
    \item emphasis on the different modes and different tissues

    \item Utrack 
    \item Cellpose
    \item Tissuenet
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test-Time Adaptation}

TTA is a method that attemtpts to solve the issue of drift in the data distribution between the training and testing data. This serves the purpose of makine a model that is generalizable 


\begin{itemize}
\item the history of TTA by what it solves 
\item how to measure correctness and the fit of the model to the current data
\item different ways to apply TTA to a model
\end{itemize}
