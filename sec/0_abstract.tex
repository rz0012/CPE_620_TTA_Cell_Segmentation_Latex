Multi Cell Tracking and lineage construction is an ongoing challenge in the biomedical community. Many works have either directly adapted Multi-Object Tracking frameworks or modified them to work for their specific dataset. However, these simple adaptations render two major challenges: (i) individual cells do not possess distinctive appearances as objects would in macro world. (ii) cells go through mitosis and apoptosis. These challenges require developing an approach from ground up. The major challenge within such cases is the variability across cell types and imaging modalities. Even when using approaches tailored to tracking cells, they still render ineffective when distribution changes drastically. Major source of this performance deterioration is the inaccuracies in the detection of the cells even before linking stage. In this work, we propose to alleviate this challenge by introducing a Test-Time Adaptation procedure for the detection phase, which in this case is segmentation. Upon better segmentation, the linking accuracy should also improve, thus increasing the performance of tracking all together in drastically changing distributions of various datasets.
