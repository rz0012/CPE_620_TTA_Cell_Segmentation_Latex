\section{Conclusions}
We have presented our hypotheses and experiments for a Test-Time adaptation of a cell segmentation model called Cellpose~\cite{stringer2021cellpose}. We demonstrated the ability to train BN parameters through self-entropy and self-supervised, contrastive flow loss.  This was applied to a grid of domain adaptation tests from the Cellpose dataset to tissues from vastly different specimens and captured in a different imaging modality. We were able to show an increase over the baseline for all six of the experiments.   Due to the ubiquity of Batch Normalization in networks this approach can be applied in a lot more going forward.  For next steps towards making this a potentially successful paper we should be comparing this to other TTA approaches like those referenced in \ref{sec:RW}, until then we cannot position ourselves in the field accurately.
